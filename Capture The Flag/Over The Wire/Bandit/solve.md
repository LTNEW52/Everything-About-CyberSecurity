# THIS IS THE SOLVE AND WHAT I LEARNED FROM PLAYING BANDIT GAMES

# BANDIT 0

TO CONNECT SSH, THE COMMAND IS, ssh IP/LINK -p PORT -l USERNAME

# BANDIT 0 -> BANDIT 1

TO SEE DIRECTORIES OR FILES, COMMAND IS ls . AND TO READ A FILE, COMMAND IS cat FILE_NAME. PASS IS ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If , USING THIS , CONNECTED TO NEXT GAME OVER SSH

# BANDIT 1 -> BANDIT 2

TO OPEN (-) FILE , WE CAN USE cat ./- . I PREVIOUSLY OPENED .sh FILE USING ./FILE.sh . PASS IS 263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx.

# BANDIT 2 -> BANDIT 3

FILE CONTAINING SPACE , HAVE (\ ) BETWEEN THEM. cat (TAB KEY) AUTOCOMPLETES IT. PASS IS MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx.

# BANDIT 3 -> BANDIT 4

TO SEE HIDDEN FILES , COMMAND IS ls -a , I KNEW IT FROM GIT! PASS IS 2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ.

# BANDIT 4 -> BANDIT 5

NON READABLE FILE HAVE WEIRD SYMBOLS IN THEM, cat EVERYFILE HELPS FINDING THE SECRET. PASS IS 4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw.

# BANDIT 5 -> BANDIT 6

TO FIND FILES WITH SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT, COMMAND IS find. FOR THIS PROBLEM, WE NEED TO FIND THE CURRENT DIRECTORY AND ALL SUB DIRECTORY, SO WE USED . , THEN FOR FILE TYPE, -type f. FOR SIZE IS -size 1033c (c for byte). THEN NON EXECUTABLE, so ! -executable. TOTAL COMMAND IS find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable. PASS IS HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG

# BANDIT 6 -> BANDIT 7

IT WAS TRICKY. TO FIND ALL FILE, find / , FOR SPECIFIC USER, -user. GROUP, -group. THIS PROBLEM HAD SPECIFIC USER AND GROUP, AS WELL AS SIZE. SO THE COMMAND BECAME find / -user USERNAME -group GROUPNAME -size SIZEINBYTEc . PASS IS morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj.

# BANDIT 7 -> BANDIT 8

STANDARD FILE WORD SEARCH. cat TO SHOW FILE CONTENT, grep TO FIND SPECIFIC WORD. cat FILE_NAME | grep WORD. PASS IS dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc.

# BANDIT 8 -> BANDIT 9

SO IF FILES HAVE MULTIPLE REOCCURING LINE, AND WE HAVE TO FIND A TEXT WITH SINGLE OCCURENCE, WE NEED TO sort THE FILE FIRST, THEN FIND uniq -u. -u HELPS FINDING LINES OCCURE ONLY ONCE. THE COMMAND BECOMES cat FILE_NAME | sort FILE_NAME | uniq -u . PASS IS 4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM.

# BANDIT 9 -> BANDIT 10

TO READ HUMAN READABLE TEXT FROM BINARY FILE, strings IS USED. strings FIND HUMAN READABLE TEXT, grep CAN FIND SPECIFIC PATTERN. PASS IS FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey.

# BANDIT 10 -> BANDIT 11

BASE64 DECODING. THERE IS ONLINE DECODER AVAILABLE. PASS IS dtR173fZKb0RRsDFSGsg2RWnpNVj3qRr.

# BANDIT 11 -> BANDIT 12

ROT13 DECODING. THERE IS ONLINE DECODER AVAILABLE. PASS IS 7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4.

# BANDIT 12 -> BANDIT 13

IT WAS SO COMPLEX AND TOUGH, BUT IT WAS REWARDING AS HELL! LETS TALK ABOUT IT STEP BY STEP.

1. HEX DUMP FILE IS USUALLY DONE IN THE CONTEXT OF EITHER DEBUGGING, REVERSE ENGINEERING OR DIGITAL FORENSICS. HEX DUMP FILE CAN BE CONVERT BACK TO BINARY BY THE COMMAND
   xxd -r HEX_FILE > OUTPUT_FILE

2. AFTER THAT file COMMAND SHOWS WHAT TYPE FILE IT IS. THIS COMMAND CAN HELP DECRYPTING FILES AND RETRIEVE INFORMATION.

3. THIS FILE IS ENCRYPTED MULTIPLE TIME BY gzip , bzip2 and tar. WE CAN USE THEIR DECRYPT METHOD TO DECRYPT THE FILE. SUCH AS,
   a. gunzip FILE.gz
   b. bunzip2 FILE.bz / FILE
   c. tar -xvf FILE

PASS IS FO5dwFsc0cbaIiH0h8J2eUks2vdTDwAn.

# BANDIT 13 -> BANDIT 14

NOT ANYTHING FOR THIS LEVEL.

# BANDIT 14 -> BANDIT 15

TO CONNECT TO THIS BANDIT, WE NEED TO USE RSA WE WERE GIVEN IN PAST LEVEL. COPYING IT IN TEXT FILE COMPLAINS ABOUT BEING TOO OPEN, SO RESTRICT THE PERMISSION, THE COMMAND IS,
chmod u+rw go-rwx FILE_NAME.

PASS FOR THIS LEVEL IS MU4VWeTyJk8ROof1qqmcBPaLh7lDCPvS.

NOW WE NEED TO SEND TCP HANDSHAKE OR CONNECT TO PORT 30000 OF LOCALHOST(BANDIT). COMMAND IS, netcat localhost 30000. THEN WE HAVE TO SEND CURRENT PASSWORD.

PASS FOR NEXT LEVEL IS 8xCjnmgoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tKJQo.

# BANDIT 15 -> BANDIT 16

SO THE PREVIOUS CONNECTION WAS UNPROTECTED TCP CONNECTION, WHICH HAD NO ENCRYPTION. THIS IS A ENCRYPTED CONNECTION USING SSL/TLS. TO USE ENCRYPTED CONNECTION, THE COMMAND IS,

openssl s_client -connect HOST:PORT

PASS IS kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx.

# BANDIT 16 -> BANDIT 17
