# THIS IS THE SOLVE AND WHAT I LEARNED FROM PLAYING BANDIT GAMES

# BANDIT 0

TO CONNECT SSH, THE COMMAND IS, ssh IP/LINK -p PORT -l USERNAME

# BANDIT 0 -> BANDIT 1

TO SEE DIRECTORIES OR FILES, COMMAND IS ls . AND TO READ A FILE, COMMAND IS cat FILE_NAME. USING PASSWORD , CONNECTED TO NEXT GAME OVER SSH

# BANDIT 1 -> BANDIT 2

TO OPEN (-) FILE , WE CAN USE cat ./- . I PREVIOUSLY OPENED .sh FILE USING ./FILE.sh .

# BANDIT 2 -> BANDIT 3

FILE CONTAINING SPACE , HAVE (\ ) BETWEEN THEM. cat (TAB KEY) AUTOCOMPLETES IT.

# BANDIT 3 -> BANDIT 4

TO SEE HIDDEN FILES , COMMAND IS ls -a , I KNEW IT FROM GIT!

# BANDIT 4 -> BANDIT 5

NON READABLE FILE HAVE WEIRD SYMBOLS IN THEM, cat EVERYFILE HELPS FINDING THE SECRET.

# BANDIT 5 -> BANDIT 6

TO FIND FILES WITH SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT, COMMAND IS find. FOR THIS PROBLEM, WE NEED TO FIND THE CURRENT DIRECTORY AND ALL SUB DIRECTORY, SO WE USED . , THEN FOR FILE TYPE, -type f. FOR SIZE IS -size 1033c (c for byte). THEN NON EXECUTABLE, so ! -executable. TOTAL COMMAND IS find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable.

# BANDIT 6 -> BANDIT 7

IT WAS TRICKY. TO FIND ALL FILE, find / , FOR SPECIFIC USER, -user. GROUP, -group. THIS PROBLEM HAD SPECIFIC USER AND GROUP, AS WELL AS SIZE. SO THE COMMAND BECAME find / -user USERNAME -group GROUPNAME -size SIZEINBYTEc .

# BANDIT 7 -> BANDIT 8

STANDARD FILE WORD SEARCH. cat TO SHOW FILE CONTENT, grep TO FIND SPECIFIC WORD. cat FILE_NAME | grep WORD.

# BANDIT 8 -> BANDIT 9

SO IF FILES HAVE MULTIPLE REOCCURING LINE, AND WE HAVE TO FIND A TEXT WITH SINGLE OCCURENCE, WE NEED TO sort THE FILE FIRST, THEN FIND uniq -u. -u HELPS FINDING LINES OCCURE ONLY ONCE. THE COMMAND BECOMES cat FILE_NAME | sort FILE_NAME | uniq -u .

# BANDIT 9 -> BANDIT 10

TO READ HUMAN READABLE TEXT FROM BINARY FILE, strings IS USED. strings FIND HUMAN READABLE TEXT, grep CAN FIND SPECIFIC PATTERN.

# BANDIT 10 -> BANDIT 11

BASE64 DECODING. THERE IS ONLINE DECODER AVAILABLE.

# BANDIT 11 -> BANDIT 12

ROT13 DECODING. THERE IS ONLINE DECODER AVAILABLE.

# BANDIT 12 -> BANDIT 13

IT WAS SO COMPLEX AND TOUGH, BUT IT WAS REWARDING AS HELL! LETS TALK ABOUT IT STEP BY STEP.

1. HEX DUMP FILE IS USUALLY DONE IN THE CONTEXT OF EITHER DEBUGGING, REVERSE ENGINEERING OR DIGITAL FORENSICS. HEX DUMP FILE CAN BE CONVERT BACK TO BINARY BY THE COMMAND
   xxd -r HEX_FILE > OUTPUT_FILE

2. AFTER THAT file COMMAND SHOWS WHAT TYPE FILE IT IS. THIS COMMAND CAN HELP DECRYPTING FILES AND RETRIEVE INFORMATION.

3. THIS FILE IS ENCRYPTED MULTIPLE TIME BY gzip , bzip2 and tar. WE CAN USE THEIR DECRYPT METHOD TO DECRYPT THE FILE. SUCH AS,
   a. gunzip FILE.gz
   b. bunzip2 FILE.bz / FILE
   c. tar -xvf FILE

# BANDIT 13 -> BANDIT 14

I GOT A SSH PRIVATE KEY HERE.

# BANDIT 14 -> BANDIT 15

TO CONNECT TO THIS BANDIT, WE NEED TO USE RSA KEY WE WERE GIVEN IN PAST LEVEL. COPYING IT IN TEXT FILE COMPLAINS ABOUT BEING TOO OPEN, SO RESTRICT THE PERMISSION, THE COMMAND IS,
chmod u+rw go-rwx FILE_NAME.

NOW WE NEED TO SEND TCP HANDSHAKE OR CONNECT TO PORT 30000 OF LOCALHOST(BANDIT). COMMAND IS, netcat localhost 30000. THEN WE HAVE TO SEND CURRENT PASSWORD.

# BANDIT 15 -> BANDIT 16

SO THE PREVIOUS CONNECTION WAS UNPROTECTED TCP CONNECTION, WHICH HAD NO ENCRYPTION. THIS IS A ENCRYPTED CONNECTION USING SSL/TLS. TO USE ENCRYPTED CONNECTION, THE COMMAND IS,

openssl s_client -connect HOST:PORT

# BANDIT 16 -> BANDIT 17

THE PROBLEM HERE WAS THAT IF NOT USED WITH -ign_eof, SOME KEY AT THE START DO OTHER WORK, THATS WHY IT SHOWED KEYUPDATE. THE COMMAND FOR THIS IS,

openssl s_client -connect IP@PORT -ign_eof

# BANDIT 17 -> BANDIT 18

diff COMMAND CAN BE USED TO DETECT CHANGES BETWEEN 2 FILES. WITH ONLY diff, THE CHANGES ARE SHOWED AS < AND >. diff -u GIVES MORE CONTEXT IN THE OUTPUT.

# BANDIT 18 -> BANDIT 19

IF BASH IS CONFIGURED SUCH AS IT EXISTS SOON AS LOGIN, WE CAN USE OUR OLD sh. THE COMMAND BECOMES

ssh IP -p PORT -l USERNAME sh

# BANDIT 19 -> BANDIT 20

THIS WAS TOUGH BUT SURPISINGLY FUN! SO SETUID or s IN FILE PERMSSION ACTUALLY SAYS, RUN THE FILE AS ME, WHOEVER RUNS DO NOT MATTER. WE CAN USE THIS TO RUN ADDITIONAL COMMAND, SUCH AS,

./VULNERABLE_FILE cat TARGET_FILE

# BANDIT 20 -> BANDIT 21

THIS IS VERY MUCH SIMILAR TO EXPLOITING METSPLOITLAB2 REVERSE SHELL. A LISTENER IS NEEDED FIRST, THEN WE ARE CONNECTED TO LISTENER, WHEN PASSWORD IS SENT THROUGH LISTENER, OTHER SIDE RESPOND. IT IS THE SAME AS REVERSE SHELL.

netcat -lvnp PORT
./SETUID_FILE PORT

PASS IS EeoULMCra2q0dSkYj561DX7s1CpBuOBt

# BANDIT 21 -> BANDIT 22
